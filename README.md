# Decistion Tree Implementation

This assignment aimed at finding an efficient C++ implementation of an ensemble of decision tree learners
with high accuracy and low runtime.

This was done by using the CART algorithm combined with boostraping. 
The implementation of CART as an ensemble model led to a performant balance between execution time and accuracy. Accuracy is comparable with the results obtained with sklearn while the execution time is of 3 seconds.
